# basho_stats [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/basho/basho_stats.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/basho/basho_stats)

Until I have a chance to better document everything:

    ./rebar compile -> builds the library
    ./rebar clean   -> remove all generated files
    ./rebar eunit   -> run the eunit tests
    ./rebar install -> install the library into your OTP root

Add `verbose=1` to any of the above commands to see more output from rebar.

Add `force=1` to forcibly install the library, even if it's previously been installed.
